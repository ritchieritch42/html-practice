        <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans 
            the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my 
            first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan 
            out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule 
            and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about 
            blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then 
            check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers 
            you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get 
            excited!</p>

        <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be 
            uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is 
            about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have 
            chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to 
            wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want 
            to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
