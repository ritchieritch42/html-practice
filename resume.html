  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h4>Specialty Coffee</h4>
      <p>
        Every since living in Colorado Springs, I've been a huge fan of specialty coffee
        and the spaces that it has created for communities. I've owned, refurbished, and sold 
        a few different espresso machines and grinders as well.
      </p>
    <h4>Fantasy Football</h4>
      <p>
        My friends and I from college have an ongoing Fantasy Football Dynasty League,
        and this year we're traveling to Florida for the draft. Lots of wings, drinks, and arguing over whether someone upbidded us or not. 
        For the next 3-4 months, I spend a lot of free time managing my players to get to the playoffs.
      </p>
    <h4>Eating Good Food</h4>
      <p>
        My wife and I spend a lot of time making and or going to eat enjoyable food. 
        Our favorite cuisines are Central/South American and Pacific Asian food. Lately, Indonesian fried rice and Thai
        tom yum soup has been hitting the spot.
      </p>
    <h4>Binging TV Shows</h4>
      <p>
        Everything from Netflix to Max to Crunchyroll. My wife and I love buying our favorite snacks and binging whichever hit show is out. Recent top shows
        include Beef, Barry, and Breaking Bad.
